# NGBoost-BridgeSeismicAssessment
A machine learning framework for seismic damage assessment of bridges using NGBoost. The project develops probabilistic models to predict bridge damage states under earthquake ground motions

Title of the paper: "Rapid assessment of bridge post-earthquake response using unsupervised clustering and probabilistic machine learning under large-scale Kik-Net data"
