# NGBoost-BridgeSeismicAssessment

A machine learning framework for **seismic damage assessment of bridges** using NGBoost.  
This project develops **probabilistic models** to predict bridge damage states under earthquake ground motions, supporting fragility analysis and post-earthquake risk evaluation.
